        <h3> Why You Should Visit </h3> <!-- explains some background information and some activities you can do  -->
            <p> The Cook Islands are comprised of 15 individual islands near the Northeast of New Zealand between French Polynesia and American Samoa. The natives there, also known as the Maori from a Polynesian descent, are friendly and helpful people who stick to their own cultural ways. While on the Cook Islands, which ever one you want to visit, you can immerse into their way of life with multiple activities. Some activities include a Half-Day Muri Lagoon Cruise with lunch made by natives or even just relaxing on One Foot Island. Whatever activities you do will result in the best experience of your lifetime. </p>

        <h4> Personal Reviews </h4> <!-- will show you reviews on the place and why they liked or disliked the location -->
            <blockquote> "Great place to relax and hang out. This was my first time in Rarotonga and by far is the best island I have ever been too. Everyone here is very frendly. Will definitely be returning with my friends and family." - Roger S. </blockquote>
        
            <blockquote> "Even more amazing the second time. We have just returned from our second stay at Rumours and it is the best place to stay in Rarotonga by far. One of the main concerns for us also was the privacy aspect. They meet that outstandingly with allowing us the control of who could come into our villa or not. If we could give Rumours 10 stars out of 5 we would. We cant wait to go back." - Cary and Jo </blockquote>
        
            <blockquote> "Yay thank you Viliâ€™s Burger Joint. Great burgers, friendly service. Good for a low key, yummy dinner in Muri. Best burger on Raro for sure!" - Harper Q. </blockquote>
